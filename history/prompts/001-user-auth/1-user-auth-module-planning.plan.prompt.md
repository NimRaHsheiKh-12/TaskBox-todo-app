# Prompt History Record

## Prompt
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response
```
Successfully completed the planning phase for the user authentication module. The following artifacts were created:

1. Implementation Plan (plan.md): Contains technical context, constitution check, and project structure
2. Research Summary (research.md): Details technology decisions and security considerations
3. Data Model (data-model.md): Defines the User entity and JWT token structure
4. API Contracts (contracts/auth-api-contract.md): Specifies authentication endpoints and request/response formats
5. Quickstart Guide (quickstart.md): Provides setup and usage instructions for developers

All constitution requirements have been verified and properly addressed in the design. The agent context has been updated with the new technology stack information. The implementation is ready to proceed to the task breakdown phase.
